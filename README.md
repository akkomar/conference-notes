* Scala binary incompatibilities between minor versions come also from the fact that they cannot change JVM implementation - compare this with Java: if some bug is found, they can fix it in JVM
* TASTY - serialization of typed AST - can be nice for static code analysis tools (Findbugs for Scala?), should also help with binary compatibility issues

### Day 2
## Keynote
* conflict free replicated data types

## Type-Safe Off-heap memory for Scala


## Scala at Twitter
