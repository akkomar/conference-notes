### Day 1
## Keynote

* Scala binary incompatibilities between minor versions come also from the fact that they cannot change JVM implementation - compare this with Java: if some bug is found, they can fix it in JVM
* TASTY - serialization of typed AST - can be nice for static code analysis tools (Findbugs for Scala?), should also help with binary compatibility issues
